# Family-Tree

I stored family data in a new way using firebase. I made a program using a cloud database as storage. I used google firestore for my cloud database and python to read and write
to the server. It was a bit challenging learning firestore and how a non relational database worked. It took a bit but it was fun learning the basics and something pretty much new all over again. The thing I really found interesting was the query system and how it was totally different to relational databses. You can't pull out individual pieces but you can filter the documents out but it still pulls all the documents.

# Development Environment

# Future Work


* I want to make sure to have the collection and id as variables so that they can choose which document to affect.
* Share this databse with my family so that they might be able to use it as well.
* Learn how to query better.
